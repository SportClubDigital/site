    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. The Service.</h2>
        <p>a. Description. The Service provides you with the opportunity to take workout classes (each, a “Class”) and
            receiving coaching from trainers solely for your personal use. Classes are available for a variety of skill
            levels, for a variety of activities, and for varying durations. Not all classes will be available in
            perpetuity
            and Classes are subject to change at any time with or without notice and without any liability to you. The
            information provided by the Service is not a substitute for professional medical advice or a medical exam.
            The
            Service offers exercise training routines and techniques (“Training Programs”) designed for healthy
            individuals.
            A physician or other qualified health care provider can help determine what type of exercise, the frequency,
            and
            the intensity that is appropriate for each individual. Prior to beginning or modifying any exercise program
            or
            Training Programs and/or if you suffer from any pre-existing medical conditions, use any medical devices
            (such
            as a pacemaker or hearing aid) or are pregnant, you should seek the advice of your physician or other
            qualified
            healthcare professional to determine if you are healthy enough to exercise, if the Training Program you
            selected
            is appropriate for you and to provide ongoing monitoring of your health. You agree that no information
            provided
            by the Service will be used to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any medical condition without consulting a
            licensed physician. Always remain hydrated while exercising and do not rely on the Service to inform you
            when to
            drink. USE OF OR RELIANCE ON ANY OF THE TRAINING PROGRAMS, TECHNIQUES, IDEAS, AND SUGGESTIONS ACCESSED
            THROUGH
            THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE DISCRETION AND RISK. SCD EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH
            YOUR
            USE OF THE TRAINING PROGRAMS.</p>
        <p>b. Mobile Services. The Service will be accessible via a mobile phone, tablet, or any other smart or wireless
            device (collectively, “Mobile Services”). Your mobile carrier’s normal messaging, data, and other rates and
            fees
            will apply to your use of the Mobile Services. In addition, downloading, installing, or using certain Mobile
            Services may be prohibited or restricted by your mobile carrier, and not all Mobile Services may work with
            all
            carriers or devices. Therefore, you are solely responsible for checking with your mobile carrier to
            determine if
            the Mobile Services are available for your mobile device(s), what restrictions, if any, may be applicable to
            your use of the Mobile Services, and how much they will cost you.</p>

        <h2>12. Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright or Other Intellectual Property Infringements.</h2>
        <p>a. Respect of Third Party Rights. SCD respects the intellectual property of others and takes the protection
            of
            intellectual property very seriously, and we ask our users to do the same.</p>
        <p>b. Repeat Infringer Policy. SCD’s intellectual property policy is to (i) remove or disable access to material
            that SCD believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property owner or his or her agent, is
            infringing the intellectual property of a third party by being made available through the Service; and (ii)
            remove any User Content uploaded to the Service by “repeat infringers.” SCD considers a “repeat infringer”
            to be
            any user that has uploaded User Content or Feedback to or through the Service and for whom SCD has received
            more
            than two takedown notices compliant with the provisions of 17 U.S.C. § 512 with respect to such User Content
            or
            Feedback. SCD has discretion, however, to terminate the Account of any user after receipt of a single
            notification of claimed infringement or upon SCD’s own determination.</p>
        <p>c. Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement. If you believe that any content made available on or through
            the
            Service has been used or exploited in a manner that infringes an intellectual property right you own or
            control,
            then please promptly send a “Notification of Claimed Infringement” containing the following information to
            the
            Designated Agent identified below. Your Notification of Claimed Infringement may be shared by SCD with the
            user
            alleged to have infringed a right you own or control, and you hereby consent to SCD making such disclosure.
            Your
            communication must include substantially the following: i. A physical or electronic signature of a person
            authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the work(s) that has/have been allegedly infringed; ii.
            Identification of works or materials being infringed, or, if multiple works are covered by a single
            notification, then a representative list of such works; iii. Identification of the specific material that is
            claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to
            which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit SCD to locate the material; iv.
            Information reasonably sufficient to permit SCD to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and,
            if
            available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted; v. A statement that you have a good
            faith
            belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner,
            its
            agent, or the law; and vi. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under
            penalty
            of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
            infringed.</p>
        <p>d. Designated Agent Contact Information. SCD’s designated agent for receipt of Notifications of Claimed
            Infringement (the “Designated Agent”) can be contacted at:</p>
        <p>Via E-mail: <a href="mailto:info@sportclubdigital.com">info@sportclubdigital.com</a></p>
        <p>Via Mail: <strong>SCD Project LLC</strong> - Georgia, City Tbilisi, Saburtalo District, Tashkenti Lane, N9
        </p>
        <p>e. Counter Notification. If you receive a notification from SCD that material made available by you on or
            through
            the Service has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then you will have the right to
            provide SCD with what is called a “Counter Notification.” To be effective, a Counter Notification must be in
            writing, provided to SCD’s Designated Agent through one of the methods identified in Section 10.d and
            include
            substantially the following information: i. A physical or electronic signature of the subscriber; ii.
            Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location
            at
            which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled; iii. A statement under
            penalty
            of perjury that the subscriber has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result
            of
            mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and iv. The subscriber’s name,
            address,
            and telephone number, and a statement that the subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of Federal District
            Court
            for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the subscriber’s address is outside of the
            United States, then for any judicial district in which SCD may be found, and that the subscriber will accept
            service of process from the person who provided notification under Section 10.d above or an agent of such
            person.</p>
        <p>f. Reposting of Content Subject to a Counter Notification. If you submit a Counter Notification to SCD in
            response to a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then SCD will promptly provide the person who provided
            the
            Notification of Claimed Infringement with a copy of your Counter Notification and inform that person that
            SCD
            will replace the removed User Content or Feedback or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days, and
            SCD
            will replace the removed User Content or Feedback and cease disabling access to it not less than 10, nor
            more
            than 14, business days following receipt of the Counter Notification, unless SCD’s Designated Agent receives
            notice from the party that submitted the Notification of Claimed Infringement that such person has filed an
            action seeking a court order to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the
            material
            on SCD’s system or network.</p>
        <p>g. False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications. The Copyright Act provides that:</p>
        <p>[a]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. §
            512)]
            (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by
            mistake
            or misidentification, will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the
            alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service
            provider,
            who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of [SCD] relying upon such misrepresentation in
            removing
            or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed
            material
            or ceasing to disable access to it. 17 U.S.C. § 512(f).</p>
        <p>SCD reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a Notification of Claimed Infringement or
            Counter Notification in violation of the law.</p>

        <h2>13. Dispute Resolution.</h2>
        <p>a. General. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you and SCD agree that any dispute arising out of or
            in
            any way related to these Terms of Use or your use of the App, whether based in contract, tort, statute,
            fraud,
            misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the
            termination of these Terms of Use, will be resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT,
            BY
            ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU AND SCD ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO
            PARTICIPATE IN
            A CLASS ACTION.</p>
        <p>b. Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 11.a above, nothing in these Terms of Usewill be deemed to waive,
            preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims
            court;
            (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is
            available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or
            (iv) to
            file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>
        <p>c. Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and SCD will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the
            Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes
            (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this EULA, and
            will
            be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at . The arbitrator has
            exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability
            of
            this binding arbitration agreement.</p>
        <p>d. Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute
            to
            the other party by Mail (“Notice”). SCD’s address for Notice is: SCD SCD Project LLC, Georgia, City Tbilisi,
            Saburtalo District, Tashkenti Lane, N9 Attn: CFO. The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the
            claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith
            efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days
            after the Notice is received, you or SCD may commence an arbitration proceeding.</p>
        <p>e. No Class Actions. YOU AND SCD AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS
            INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
            PROCEEDING.
            Further, unless both you and SCD agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s
            claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
        <p>f. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. Except as otherwise provided in these Terms of Use, if SCD
            makes
            any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to SCD’s address for Notice, then you
            may
            reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to SCD’s address for Notice, in
            which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will
            continue
            to govern any disputes between you and SCD.</p>
        <p>g. Enforceability. If Section 11.f above is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section</p>
        <p>h. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in these Terms will limit your statutory rights to bring claims in
            your
            local courts or to seek remedies under local consumer protection laws where such rights cannot be waived by
            contract.</p>

        <h2>20. Miscellaneous.</h2>
        <p>These Terms of Use and any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to the Service are
            governed
            by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America, without
            regard
            to its conflict of law principles. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a consumer residing in a
            country
            with laws that require consumer contracts to be governed by the laws of your country of residence, then that
            law
            may apply in accordance with such requirements. You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue in,
            the
            state or federal courts located in Delaware, USA, for any dispute not subject to arbitration under these
            Terms,
            except where applicable mandatory law prohibits such restrictions. You agree that no joint venture,
            partnership,
            employment, or agency relationship exists between you and SCD as a result of these Terms of Use. You further
            acknowledge that by submitting User Content, no confidential, fiduciary, contractually implied, or other
            relationship is created between you and SCD other than pursuant to these Terms of Use. If any provision of
            these
            Terms of Use is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such
            provision
            will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use, which will remain in full
            force
            and effect. Failure of SCD to act on or enforce any provision of these Terms of Use will not be construed as
            a
            waiver of that provision or any other provision in these Terms of Use. No waiver will be effective against
            SCD
            unless made in writing, and no such waiver will be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent
            instance.
            Except as expressly agreed by SCD and you, these Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you
            and
            SCD with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements,
            whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter herein. The Section headings
            are
            provided merely for convenience and will not be given any legal import. These Terms of Use will inure to the
            benefit of our successors and assigns. You may not assign these Terms of Use or any of the rights or
            licenses
            granted hereunder, directly or indirectly, without the prior express written consent of SCD. This means that
            in
            the event you dispose of any device on which you have installed the App, such as by sale or gift, you are
            responsible for deleting the App and any SCD Content from your device prior to such disposition. SCD may
