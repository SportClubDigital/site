      <h1>SCD Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 05, 2025</p>
      <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 24, 2025</p>
    </div>

    <p>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") provides information about the personal information that SCD Project LLC dba
      SCD ("SCD," "we," "us", or "our") may collect from users ("you" or "your") of our website ("Site") and/or
      our application(s) ("App") (where the Site and App are collectively referred to as "Service") and how we use
      and share such information.</p>

    <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> SCD operates as a marketplace and distribution platform connecting fitness
      trainers and coaches with end users. We do not claim ownership of, and we do not process or use,
      trainer-created workout content or personal data relating to trainers and their clients except as strictly
      necessary for platform operations, payment processing, and legal compliance.</p>

    <p>By using the Service, you agree to the terms of this Policy. We reserve the right to modify this Policy from
      time to time, and any modifications will take effect upon posting. If we make material changes, we will
      notify you via email or a prominent notice on the Service. Please review our Policy regularly. Your
      continued use of the Service after changes are posted constitutes your agreement to the changes. If you do
      not agree to the terms of this Policy, please discontinue your use of the Service.</p>

    <h2>Summary of Key Principles</h2>

    <p><strong>Marketplace Model:</strong> SCD provides technology infrastructure for content distribution. We are
      not the creator, owner, or controller of trainer workout content. Trainers retain all intellectual property
      rights in their content.</p>

    <p><strong>Limited Data Processing:</strong> We collect and process personal data only to the extent necessary
      to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide user accounts and access to purchased content</li>
      <li>Process payments and payouts (via third-party payment processors)</li>
      <li>Ensure platform security and prevent fraud</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations</li>
      <li>Respond to user support requests</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>No Secondary Use:</strong> We do not use trainer content, workout data, or user fitness information
      for advertising, profiling, third-party sales, or any purpose unrelated to platform operation.</p>

    <p><strong>Trainer Independence:</strong> Trainers are independent contractors, not SCD employees. Personal data
      shared between trainers and their clients is controlled by the trainers, not SCD.</p>

      <li>Delivering purchased content to users</li>
      <li>Hosting and distributing trainer content through the marketplace</li>

      <li>Providing customer support</li>

    <h3>b. Platform Improvement:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Analyzing usage patterns to improve Service functionality</li>
      <li>Testing new features and developing new products</li>
      <li>Conducting research and analytics (aggregated and anonymized)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>c. Security and Fraud Prevention:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Detecting and preventing fraudulent transactions</li>
      <li>Enforcing our Terms of Use</li>
      <li>Protecting against security threats and abuse</li>
      <li>Moderating content for compliance with platform policies and legal requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>d. Legal Compliance:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Responding to legal requests and court orders</li>
      <li>Complying with tax, financial reporting, and regulatory obligations</li>
      <li>Enforcing our legal rights</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>e. Communications:</h3>

    </ul>

    <p><strong>IMPORTANT LIMITATION:</strong> We do NOT use trainer workout content, user fitness data,
      or personal workout information for advertising, third-party sales, behavioral profiling, or any commercial
      purpose unrelated to platform operation.</p>

    <h2>3. Trainer Content and Data Ownership</h2>

    <h3>a. Trainer Intellectual Property:</h3>
    <p>Trainers retain all intellectual property rights in their workout content. SCD's access to and processing of

    <h3>b. Trainer-Client Relationships:</h3>
    <p>When users purchase access to trainer content, any personal data shared between the trainer and user (such as
      progress tracking, personal messages, or coaching notes) is controlled by the trainer, not SCD. Trainers are
      responsible for their own data protection practices in their relationships with clients.</p>

    <h3>c. SCD's Limited Role:</h3>
    <p>SCD operates as a technology platform and payment processor. We do not control, analyze, or commercialize the

      purposes we specify.</p>

    <h3>c. Trainers:</h3>
    <p>When you purchase trainer content, the trainer may receive limited information about you (username, purchase
      date, access period) to facilitate content delivery and support.</p>

    <h3>d. Business Transfers:</h3>

      transferred to the acquiring entity, subject to continued protection under this Policy.</p>
